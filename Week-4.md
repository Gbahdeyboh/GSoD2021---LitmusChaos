# Week 4
[Last week](https://github.com/Gbahdeyboh/GSoD2021---LitmusChaos/blob/master/Week-3.md), I was able to build my first ever Kubernetes Cluster that hosted a very basic applicastion. It was really fun working on the project. 

This week, I started reading about Cloud Native Technologies, Chaos Engineering,  and why it is important to build resilient systems.
It was a lot of reading but I am glad I went through them. 

I also started to learn and understand Litmus, how it works and how to use it. Been going through a series of [Litmus Tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmM1fgu30seVGFyNIEyDgAq6KnzgW2p3m) on the youtube alongsides reading the documentation and some blog posts.
I was able to set up my first Chaos workflow with Litmus ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³.

### What did I learn
- What CLoud Native apps are and how to explain them.
- What Chaos Enginering is.
- Why it is important for systems to be resilient.
- Litmus

## What could I have done better?
I spent too much time reading a lot of theory, I should have picked Litmus up a bit earlier during the week. I also did not get to take a look at using Google Codelabs to create tutorials.

## What were the challenges I faced?

## What's next?
- Get more familiar with the Litmus tutorials structure and the tools I would be needing to contribute to it e.g codelab.
- Learn to build more Chaos workflows
- Start writing my first tutorial ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³.
