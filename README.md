# GSoD2021---LitmusChaos

This repository serves as an easy reference point for all my weekly activities during my GSoD 2021 internship at LitmusChaos. For each week, I would be documenting my work, thought process, reasons for making certain decisions, and most importantly progress.

The weekly breakdown would make it easy for anyone reviewing what has been done to locate certain things and get insights into how I approached solving them. It would also help me reflect back on why I made certain decisions and can come in handy for future GSoD interns/mentors.

Each week is a new markdown file and it would be updated as I progress.
