# Week 1
Litmus is a Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering platform that helps SREs & Developers identify and fix weaknesses in their system.

To contribite to Litmus documentation and help create new Tutorials, it is required that I have an understanding of Chaos Engineering and Cloud Native technologies.
Litmus itself is built atop of Kuberneters, which makes knowledge of Kubernetes very important to the learning curve of Litmus. 

I previously had some basic knowledge of Docker, but that was a long time ago. Since Kubernetes is a requirement, I decided to learn some Docker again before moving forward.

I spent the first two days of this week trying to learn Docker to a substantial amount before moving on to Kubernetes. I started with this [Children's Guide to Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/the-childrens-illustrated-guide-to-kubernetes/), then moved on to the [free Kubernetes course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-getting-started/). I eventually didn't complete this course as I wasn't understanding a lot of things quite well and it seemed to contain a lot of theories(Looking back, I think I should have).

I moved to exploring the [Kubernetics Bascis Interractive Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) on Kubernetes documentation page and I figured I had the same problem I previously had. For some reaoson, I wasn't understanding a lot of things. The docs seemed to assume that I have some prerequisite  knowledge that I do not have. For example, words like "Clusters", "Pods", "Deployments", etc where quite new to me in the Kubernetes space and I had to Google it most of the time. 

I decided to check out [Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do) on Youtube by Nana because it had great reviews. This course was just what I needed to get started. Nana is an amazing tutor, she started by giving illustrated slides of what each term meant, what they did, and how they relate to Kubernetes. I was able to Understand a lot of things from Nana's course. 

After I completed the first few parts of Nana's course, I decided to go back to the Kubernetes docs and it made a lot more sense to me this time around.

I will continue Nana's course in week 2 and hopefully complete it.

### What did I learn?
- Docker, docker-compose.
- Container Orchestration Engines.
- Components of a Worker Node (Theory)
   - Pods
   - Services
   - Ingress
   - ConfigMaps
   - Secrets
   - Deployments
- Kubernetes Architectures
  - Kubelets
  - Kube proxy
  - Container Runtimes
  - Master Nodes
    - API Server
    - Scheduler
    - Controller Manager
    - etcd
- Created ny first Cluster with Minikube(Interractve tutorial)
- Deployed an app using Kubectl(Interractive Tutorial)


## What could I have done better?
- I wasted too much time trying to fix Bugs while learning Docker. I could have used those wasted time to learn some more relevant stuffs.
- Learning Docker was helpful, but it wasn't necessary. Basic Knowledge of conatiners was sufficent.

- I opted out of the Udemy course I took because it was boring and I wasn't understanding it the way I thought I would. I should have finished the course regardless.

## What were the challenges I faced?
Transitioning from core Software Engineering to Cloud Native isn't as easy as I thought it would be. There's a lot of new stuffs to learn. 
I came with the assumption that I would be familiar with most of the technologies and terms, but that was an ignorant assumption. I had to unlearn that mindset and approach things like I have never written a line of code before.
