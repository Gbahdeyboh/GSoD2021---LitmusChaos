Litmus is a Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering platform that helps SREs & Developers identify and fix weaknesses in their system.

To contribite to Litmus Documentation and help create new Tutorials, it is required that I have an Understanding of Chaos Engineering and Cloud Native technologies.
Litmus itself is built atop of Kuberneters, which makes knowledge of Kubernetes very important to the learning curve of Litmus. 

I previously had some basic knowledge of Docker, but that was a long time ago. Since Kubernetes is a requirement, I decided to learn some Docker again before moving forward.

I spent the first two days of this week trying to learn Docker to a substancial amount befiore moving on to Kubernetes. I started with this [Children's Guide to Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/the-childrens-illustrated-guide-to-kubernetes/) .
